This file will be filled out more in depth at a later date, however there are a few rules I'd like to try and follow in this codebase.

**Rules**
* Don't use `var` only use `let` or `const`
* `require` is fine for now, as I do not plan to use ES6 Modules
* Variables are `snakeCased`
* Functions are `snakeCased`
* Files with general functions grouped together must be prefixed with a _. `Example _commands.js`
